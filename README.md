# shop-management-system
In this milestone, I set up the Laravel backend project, configure authentication using Laravel Sanctum for SPA, implement user and branch management with RBAC basics, and create the initial database schema with migrations. The frontend is initialized with Vue 3 (Composition API), Vite, Pinia, vue-router, Bootstrap 5, and SweetAlert2.
